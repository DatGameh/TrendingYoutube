# TrendingYoutube
Our project for the CruzHacks hackathon is to use a data set on trending youtube statistics from kaggle to make a simple ui using Streamlit that prompts the user for a date and then it lists the trending videos or keywords for that specific day (with the links, if applicable). We also intend to include functionality to sort the trending videos by the number of views. 

This is a forked version, with the intended changes being the keeping of HelloVorl.
